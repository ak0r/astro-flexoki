Here is the link to [Astro.js](https://astro.build/) website. Do you want to link a long text [here how it looks in this theme](https://astro.build/).

### Paragraph

Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.

It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

### Callout

Callout Support's `Title`, `Theme` and `Icon`. Also they all can be empty! <br/>
Themes are `info` | `warning` | `success` | `error`. <br/>
You can use <a href="https://emojipedia.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emoji</a> as icon. <br/> if you keep the `icon=""`; it will be default icon. and if you didn't set it; no icon will be shown. <br/>
**You can use Markdown and HTML both inside callout.**

```html
<Callout title="Astro Is Awesome" theme="info" icon="ðŸ”¥">
  **Create your own platform on the web.** Astro is a tool for building static websites with your favorite JS framework. But it will ship zero JavaScript to the browser ðŸ¤¯.
